INTRODUCTION

The "Online payments Fraud Detection Dataset" was chosen with the intention of creating a reliable system for identifying fraudulent activity related to online payments.

Project Outcome: 
To provide a dataset appropriate for machine learning algorithms, the intended result is a fraud detection model that makes use of Label encoding for categorical characteristics. With greater precision and efficiency, the model should be able to detect fraudulent transactions.
